# WritersFlock

In recent years, the integrity of media houses and newspapers have come into question due to their apparent inability to deliver “objective journalism”. 
“Fake news” is a short phrase for what is heavily opinionated, emotional, subjective, one-sided print media and news agency. It is essential to gain the 
trust of people in this times when votes can be hacked. It is almost irresistible for writers and journalists to give in to emotions and subjectivity in 
hyper-sensitive environment but at the same time they have to deliver the message while ‘tiptoeing’ around sensitive topics e.g. gender, race, immigration status. 


The problem is faced by many politicians or celebrities who lost their professions, societal status due to a wrong tweet, news article or comment, 
it is imperative to weigh your words. 


“Writer’s flock” (resemblance with “writer’s block” is intended) is a way a journalist, a writer working in print media can be sure how objective and neutral 
their articles are. Writer’s flock gives an immediate feedback from an outsider/layman’s point of view in terms of how positive, negative, neutral or mixed it is. 
They can also know where they need to be less verbose and where they need to be more detail oriented. The app can be further enhanced to perform web-scraping and 
get the overall sentiments and analytics of articles online. The app can advice the author how well the image included in the article conveys the message of the 
article.

In short the idea behind ‘Writer’s flock’ is to show the writers all the ‘fifty shades of sentiment’ flocking around their article.
